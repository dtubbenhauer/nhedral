# Code and Erratum for *On Hecke and asymptotic categories for complex reflection groups*

I collected a bit of SageMath and Magma code relevant for the paper *On Hecke and asymptotic categories for complex reflection groups*
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03044">https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03044</a> on this page.

The code is in a **.sage** file or **.m** file, respectively, that can be downloaded from this site (or copied from below) and you can run it with SageMath or Magma.
All files will run in the respective online calculators, see either here <a href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a> or 
<a href="http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/">Magma</a>.

An Erratum for the paper *On Hecke and asymptotic categories for complex reflection groups* can be found at the bottom of the page.

# Background

The Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind $U_e=U_e(X)$ are are certain well-studied and important polynomials, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials</a>. 
In representation theory one renormalizes them so that they satisfy the recursion

$$U_0=1,U_1=X,\text{ and otherwise }U_{e}=XU_{e-1}+U_{e-2}.$$

Their roots, the numbers $2\cos(e\pi/n)$, are everywhere in mathematics.

The crucial observation is that this recursion matches the fusion (=tensor product) rule of $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$.
An important construction due to Koornwinder for $SL_3(\mathbb{C})$, and Eier and Lidl in general, are certain polynomials, 
the Koornwinder polynomials, that are attached to the fusion rules of, say, $SL_N(\mathbb{C})$. All the code below is about computing and illustrating the 
roots of the Koornwinder polynomials.

# The SageMath code

All roots of Koornwinder polynomials have their first coordinate in the interior of the N-cusped hypocycloid of parametric equation

$$x(\theta)=(N-1)\cos(\theta)+\cos\big((N-1)\theta\big)\text{ and }y(\theta)=(N-1)\sin(\theta)-\sin\big((N-1)\theta\big).$$

Recall that these are plane curves generated by following a point on a circle of radius 1 that rolls within a circle of radius N. Here are the pictures:

To be completely explicit, let $N=4$ and $e=2$. The common roots of the Chebyshev-like polynomials are:

$$(0,-1,0),(0,1,0),(\sqrt{3}i,-2,-\sqrt{3}i),(-\sqrt{3}i,-2,\sqrt{3}i),(\sqrt{3},2,\sqrt{3}),(-\sqrt{3},2,-\sqrt{3}),(e^{2i\pi/8},0,e^{14i\pi/8}),(e^{6i\pi/8},0,e^{10i\pi/8}),(e^{10i\pi/8},0,e^{6i\pi/8}),(e^{14i\pi/8},0,e^{2i\pi/8}).$$

We have the following plot of the first coordinates:

The following SageMath code will create tex code to plot these pictures.
